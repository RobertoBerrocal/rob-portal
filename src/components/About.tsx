              , and my journey into the world of data began in 2019 when I took
              my first course in Power BI. That was the moment I fell in love
              with data, leading me to continue learning SQL and Python on my
              own.

              In 2020, I started my first internship as an IT Intern in the
              banking sector, where I gained valuable experience in data
              visualization and project management. The following year, in 2021,
              I worked as a Professional Intern in the energy sector, automating
              workflows and reports using Power Automate and Power BI. By 2022,
              I landed my first full-time role as a Data Analyst in the brewery
              industry, where I developed high-quality dashboards and conducted
              deep statistical data analysis. During this period, I also honed
              my skills in Data Engineering and Machine Learning.

              In June 2024, I moved to Germany to pursue a Masterâ€™s degree in
              Data Science, AI & Digital Business. A few months later, I started
              working as a Working Student Software Engineer, where I deepened
              my knowledge of React, TypeScript, and Node.js, with a strong
              focus on Front-End Development.

              I am a self-driven learner who is always eager to embrace new
              challenges and opportunities for growth. My passion lies in
              technology, data, and innovation. I thrive in multicultural
              environments, enjoy team collaboration, and continuously seek to
              expand my expertise. As a native Spanish speaker, I am fluent in
              English and currently learning German.

              Beyond my professional journey, I have a deep love for traveling,
              exploring new cultures, and trying new food. I am a football
              enthusiast, an avid Champions League fan, and a passionate dancer,
              especially in salsa and bachata.
